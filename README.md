# Advance-Class-Governance-Pro


This is a mini Project which manages the whole class system.

• First sees if the person has worn a mask or not.

• If yes then It will take his/her attendance by face recognition.

• Then it takes the snapshot of the notes written on board by the teacher and stores it in a folder.

• Lastly takes the whole audio recording of the class( the time of recording can be changed) and saves it inside another folder.

• After the class the folder with snapshots and Audio can be shared with the students.
